Machine Learning using KNN Classifier and Visualization on Handwritten USPS Dataset

## USPS dataset

[Handwitten Digits USPS dataset](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/291440/) has 7291 train and 2007 test images. The images are 16*16 grayscale pixels. The dataset is given in [hdf5 file format](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), the hdf5 file has two groups train and test and each group has two datasets: data and target.
