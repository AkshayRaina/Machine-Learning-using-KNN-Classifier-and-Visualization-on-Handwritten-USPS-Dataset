Machine Learning using KNN Classifier and Visualization on Handwritten USPS Dataset

## USPS dataset

Handwitten Digits USPS dataset has 7291 train and 2007 test images. The images are 16*16 grayscale pixels. The dataset is given in hdf5 file format, the hdf5 file has two groups train and test and each group has two datasets: data and target.
